## About Me
I'm a recent computer engineering graduate with a passion for learning and exploring various fields. Here's what I'm currently diving into:

1. **Linear Algebra:** I'm fascinated by the mathematical foundations that underpin many areas of computer science and engineering. I will use linear algebra to
   work on computer graphics and ASCII art. It's also foundational in the fields of machine learning and deep learning.

3. **C Programming Language:** As a programmer, mastering C is essential. I'm honing my skills by working on projects and exploring its intricacies.

4. **Data Processing and ML:** Python is my go-to language for data manipulation and machine learning. Libraries like Pandas and SciPy allow me to analyze data and build predictive models.

5. **Electronics and Digital Logic:** Understanding how circuits work at the fundamental level is crucial. I'm delving into digital logic and exploring microcontrollers.

## Projects
- ðŸ§¬ **Game of Life:** Check out my implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C! It's mesmerizing to watch patterns evolve.
- ðŸ“· **ITCB** I'm yet to complete the second part of this project, however, the Floyd-Steinberg image dithering algorithm is implemented and you can use it.
