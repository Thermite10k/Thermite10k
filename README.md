## About Me
I'm a recent Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for learning and exploring various fields. Here's what I'm currently diving into:

1. **Linear Algebra:** I'm fascinated by the mathematical foundations that underpin many areas of computer science and engineering. I will use linear algebra to
   work on computer graphics and ASCII art. It's also foundational in the fields of machine learning and deep learning.

3. **C Programming Language:** Knowing about computer architecture along with a low level language like C allows me to write super optimized code, that's why I got into C.

4. **Data Processing and ML:** Python is my go-to language for data manipulation and machine learning. Libraries like Pandas and SciPy allow me to analyze data and build predictive models.

5. **Electronics and Digital Logic:** Bringing microcontroller based projects to life requires a level of electronics knowledge, I want to do the right thing, the right way.

## Projects
- ðŸ§¬ **Game of Life:** Check out my implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C! It's mesmerizing to watch patterns evolve.
- ðŸ“· **ITCB** I'm yet to complete the second part of this project, however, the Floyd-Steinberg image dithering algorithm is implemented and you can use it.
